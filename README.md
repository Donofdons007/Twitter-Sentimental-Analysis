# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
In this paper we classify sentiments with the help of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, we use the datasets from Kaggle which was crawled from the internet and labeled positive/negative. The data provided comes with emoticons (emoji), usernames and hashtags which are required to be processed (so as to be readable) and converted into a standard form.
 We also need to extract useful features from the text such unigrams and bigrams which is a form of representation of the “tweet”. 
We use various machine learning algorithms based on NLP (Natural Language Processing) to conduct sentiment analysis using the extracted features. Finally, we report our experimental results and findings at the end.
